        <h2>Role of Women in the Society</h2>
        <p>
            Women are the pioneers of nation. Indian culture attaches great importance to women, comprising half of world’s
            population. According to a report of secretary general of United Nations, women constitute 50% of human resources, the
            greatest human resource next only to man having great potentiality.
            <br>
            <br>

            Women are the key to sustainable development and quality of life in the family. The varieties of role the women assume
            in the family are those of wife, leader, administrator, manager of family income and last but not the least important
            the mother.

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            Women in India represent 29 percent of the labour force, down from 35 percent in 2004. More than half of the work done
            by women in India is unpaid, and almost all of it is informal and unprotected. Women are not well represented in most
            sectors, including business leaders. Though they comprise almost 40 percent of agricultural labour, they control only 9
            percent of land in India. Women are also shut out of the formal financial system. Nearly half of India’s women do not
            have a bank or savings accounts for their own use, and 60 percent of women have no valuable assets to their name. It is
            unsurprising then that at 17 percent, India has a lower share of women’s contribution to the GDP than the global average
            of 37 percent. In addition, women face great physical insecurity. The rate of crimes against women in India stands at
            53.9 percent in India. In Delhi, the capital city, 92 percent of women reported having experienced sexual or physical
            violence in public spaces.

        <h2>Self Help Group </h2>
        <p>
            Self-help groups are typically groups of eight-10 women who meet once a week to collect money from their members,
            connecting them to banks and loaning them money at low-interest rates. In the Jai Ambe self-help group, every member
            contributes Rs 25 a week and the money can be given to any member who needs it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Every group has a president and secretary. Hemlata Devi, who is the secretary of the Jai Ambe group, has studied until
            Class 10, she said. “You need to be a little educated [to be the secretary or president] because you have to sign at the
            bank and understand these matters,” she said.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            National Rural Livelihood Mission linked several self-help groups to village-level organisations and several
            village-level organisations to a cluster-level federation. The programme also trained local women to run these
            organisations.
